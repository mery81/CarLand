**CarLand**
===========

Carland will be a console based application. The idea of the application
is to keep a record of the car and other vehicles inventory and manage
it.

**Personas:**

Brian: is the administrator of a car dealership, and who will use
CarLand to manage vehicles inventory and generate reports.

Bob: is the salesperson who will use CarLand to sell vehicles based on
inventory availability.

**Scenario:**

The application will help both administrator and a sales person to use
their respective accounts to perform action of updating the inventory.
For example, if a salesperson sells any vehicle, it will be marked sold
and the administrator will get to know about it. Furthermore,
Administrator will be able to manage inventory. For example, if any
vehicle is not available, it will be considered out of stock. Moreover,
an administrator can add any vehicle or update the stock.

Application consists of different logins.

1. A login for the salesperson

2. A login for the administrator

When the application will start, a login information page will be shown.
User can select their role. For example, one can either login as
administrator or salesperson. Login requires both a username and
password. Soon after the login is done, both administrator and
salesperson will get a different information page customized as per
their needs.

**Proposed Functionalities:**\ 

There are following functionalities in the project:

1. Login for administrator

2. Login for Salesperson

3. Password update for administrator

4. Password update for Salesperson

5. Inventory management feature for Administrator

6. Inventory selling feature for salesperson

7. Report generation in excel format for administration. It will contain
   the summary of available vehicles.

**Actual Alternatives:**

Using paper sheets for inventory management, with data entry into Excel.
Risk of error is high, and updates are not instantaneous.

**Added Value:**

1. Faster process

2. Minimal risk of error

3. Up-to-date information
